Yoga has been practiced for generations as a form of therapy for body, mind and spirit. It is a life enhancing and wellness-promoting form of exercise that not only tones the body, but also relieves the mind and spirit of the pressures of daily life. Many people practice yoga for the physical benefits, but over time notice the effect of yoga penetrates all areas of their life.

The term “yoga” translates from the Sanskrit word “yuj” meaning to join, connect, or unify. As a bridle reins in horses in a carriage, yoga is a tool for the mind to cultivate control and purposeful action in the body.  Fluid steady and calm breath, sometimes referred to as 'prana' or life force energy, anchors and enhances this union.  Energy flows through the body with complete fluidity and ease when the body and mind are working as one.

Through yoga, we recognize the interconnectedness of all beings.  We aim to relate to one another with friendliness, tolerance and compassion.   Through the practice of yoga, we work to establish peace within ourselves and peace for all beings.   It is through establishing this connection with ourselves that we self-realize and connect to the understanding of eternal grace, that which is greater than ourselves - the universal whole. 

The practice of yoga has been used over thousands of years to help people reach their highest potential. A constant evolution of ideas and adaptations have enhanced yoga over time to serve people of all walks of life and in hundreds of countries around the world. The rapid expansion of yoga is attributed to its many observable benefits.

A wealth of information and knowledge is available in books, from teachers, and on the web for anyone seeking to find out more about this deep subject. This brief overview is intended only as a general introduction.  Historically, four primary yogic texts are of significance to the study of yoga philosophy. Many, many books have followed...

**The Upanishads, 8th Century**: This holy text written in Sanskrit is revered as the original holy text, and many branches of religion emerged from this doctrine, including Hinduism and Buddhism.

**The Bhagavad-Gita, circa 400–100**: Also known as “The Divine Song”, is a set of verses from a traditional Vedic Epic, the Mahabharata. It details four paths of yoga, including Karma Yoga (actions and reactions), Jnana Yoga (intellectual knowledge), Bhakti Yoga (devotion to deities) and Raja Yoga (meditation practices).

**Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, circa 200**: One of the most important and revered texts of yoga philosophy. This set of 195 verses or philosophical “threads” outlines a method including the concept of the eight limbs of practice, which are commonly referred to in the practice of yoga.  A brief outline of the eight limbs follows here:

**The Yamas**: The Yamas are a set of attitudes that concern our interactions with others and the environment. Originally “yama” meant bridle or rein, and these concepts were meant as guides to direct our progress.

* Ahimsa\
  Non-harming of oneself and others; acting kindly and with love toward all living creatures in thought, word or deed.
* Satya\
  Speaking and acting in truth to ourselves and others
* Asteya\
  Non-stealing, feeling abundance with what we have
* Brahmacharya\
  Divine acceptance, divine action, finding the divine beauty in ourselves and others
* Aparigraha\
  Non-grasping, not coveting what is not ours, not trying to be anything or anyone but being what we are already

**The Niyamas**: The Niyamas are attitudes concerning the realization and reflection on the self.

* Saucha\
  Being and behaving in a way that is clear, clean, and pure, both in body and spirit
* Samtosha\
  Finding contentment and acceptance of where you are today without judgment or comparison; modesty
* Tapas\
  Working, effort, sweat, discipline, or heat — to purify
* Svadhyaya\
  Self study; self-awareness, self-inquiry and curiosity
* Ishvara Pranidhana\
  Faith; watching through meditation; observing life; literally “surrendering to god” — being supported by that which is bigger than yourself

**Asana**: The most recognized aspect of yoga today, includes working the muscles and tissues of the body. “Asana” literally translates as “your seat”, a place of focus and comfort.

**Pranayama**: The practice of cultivating and directing energy through the control and regulation of the breath.

**Pratyahara**: The inward journey away from the external senses into the discovery of the self and its relationship to the conscious world.

**Dharana**: The concentration of the mind through meditation and the ability for the mind to focus on only one thing at a time.

**Dhyana**: Deep meditation where the self and the object become one. A smooth flow of concentration softens the whole body into space with full awareness.

**Samadhi**: Bliss or oneness with the Divine, the highest stage of spiritual development. The state of self-realization and pure awareness.

**Hatha Yoga Pradipika, circa 15th Century**:  The most recent historical text on yoga. This book lists in great detail all the main asana (postures), pranayama (breathing techniques), mudra (symbolic hand gestures), and bandha (subtle energy locks) that we practice today. “Pradipika” translates as a lantern, “shedding light” on the subject of Hatha yoga. 

> *Slimness of body, luster on the face, clarity of voice, brightness of eyes, freedom from disease, control over sex, stimulation of gastric fire, and purification of the Nadis’s (meridian lines) are the characteristics of success in Hatha Yoga.*
