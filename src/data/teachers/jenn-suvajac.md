After traveling and living abroad for the past few years, Jenn is happy to bring her yoga teaching back to Vancouver. Jenn’s profound interest in body awareness, movement and mindfulness has led her to study under inspiring teachers in India, Bali, Europe and North America. Her explorations led her to deeper mind-body studies and earned Jenn a Bachelor Degree in Kinesiology, Diploma in Holistic Nutrition and 500 Hr Advanced Yoga Teacher Training certification. Passionate about the healing arts, Jenn brings a holistic understanding to her classes. Breath work, deep awareness, presence of mind, proper alignment and creative sequencing are the foundation of Jenn’s classes. Through mindful movement, Jenn encourages her students to tap into their oneness and experience the transformative practice of yoga. Jenn’s compassionate and attentive style make her perfect for new and advanced students looking to deepen their yogic path.
