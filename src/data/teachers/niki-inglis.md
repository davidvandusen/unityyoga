Diagnosed at age 29 with life-threatening asthma and debilitating arthritis, Niki took her first yoga class at a neighbourhood community center. Fully healed in a short time by the practice, she has devoted the last 22 years to sharing yoga with others. Along the way, she has raised three wise and beautiful girls, accumulated a wealth of knowledge about the human body and acquired a deep curiosity for the ways in which we learn, as individuals and together.

Trained in Restorative, Hot and Aerial Yoga, she leads workshops and retreats worldwide. Her classes invite you to move more slowly, in order to feel more deeply. Gentle myofascial release techniques, yoga postures, the breath, music and deep rest are combined to create an environment where your body and mind can learn to find ease.

Her deepest influence is Vijnana Yoga - a gentle but strong, inwardly-focused practice - and she strives to bring its sense of presence and peace to all of her classes. Niki encourages questions, community and connection above all else and gratitude towards her teachers, students included, guides her every move.
