Claireâ€™s love for yoga began to unfold in university whilst studying for her experimental physics degree. Continuing her asana practice during her many years as a high school teacher, it was her background in science that brought her to delve deeper into the spiritual aspects of yoga. The practice has helped Claire experience deep calmness and clarity, feel more connected and be more at peace. Relocating to Vancouver in 2016, Claire quickly immersed herself in the many yoga offerings of the city. It was a natural progression to combine her passion for yoga and learning with her teaching background, and so she completed her 200 hour yoga teacher training with Karma Teachers, soon followed by a 40 hour yin training.

In her classes, Claire aims to help you connect with the power of your breath, the joy of moving in your body, the art of sharing in community and the many holistic benefits of your yoga practice that you can take off your mat. She recognises the honour that comes with being in the sacred seat of teacher, and wishes to give students a space to tune inwards and intuitively find what they need.
