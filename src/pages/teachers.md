    Susan is devoted to her daily practice and has been teaching public classes full time for over a decade in her own studio, in corporate environments, and art and music festivals.  As a socially conscious Entrepreneur, her vision is to provide inclusive space for healing and connection where everyone has a name and voice.

    Exploring many styles of yoga on her journey, Susan has been influenced by a variety of excellent teachers and traditions. She received her initial 200 hour training at Vancouver’s Flow Yoga in 2006, completed her Anusara Yoga Teacher Training (Levels I-III) in 2010, Thai Massage (Teacher Certified) in 2011 and AcroYoga Level I and II certification in Montreal in 2014, and is constantly learning through workshops and classes. Passionate about the healing power of yoga, her classes are a fusion of the flowing grace of Vinyasa, the alignment principles of Anusara / Iyengar, the gentle pace of Hatha yoga, and the wisdom of traditional yoga philosophy. Susan enjoys working with students at every level of practice, and strives to make yoga accessible to those who need it most.

    In addition to her public classes, Susan facilitates group retreats to Salt Spring Island and various locations around the world ([unityretreats.ca](http://unityretreats.ca/)), is a practicing Clinical Herbalist ([unityherbals.ca](http://unityherbals.ca/)) and has a special interest in the esoteric, offering consultations in Four Pillars Astrology (Bazi), Tarot, I-Ching and Flying Star Feng Shui.

- teacherName: Nicola Bennett

  teacherBio: |
    Nicola is a yoga teacher and Naturopathic Doctor living and thriving in East Vancouver’s artistically rich Commercial Drive neighbourhood. She was introduced to yoga by her gymnastics coach at age 16, where she instantly fell in love with the practice and knew that she would eventually become a teacher. Her interest in the human body and its movement brought her to UBC where she completed her Bachelor's Degree in Kinesiology and Health Science. Nicola went on to earn her 200h YTT in Hatha with Open Door Yoga in 2011. She began teaching shortly afterwards and has been at Unity Yoga ever since.

    Although Nicola had always wanted to be a doctor, she realized along the way that the conventional medical system was not for her. Yoga was the key that unlocked the door to a whole new world of Eastern philosophy and healing traditions, and she soon realized there were more paths to good health than those offered by western medicine. She decided to pursue another four years of school at the Boucher Institute of Naturopathic Medicine where she became a naturopathic doctor. Her studies have enriched her yoga teachings and her classes often focus heavily on anatomy and physiology. She is particularly interested in the nervous system and how one can use breath and mindfulness to balance the nervous system. It is in this state where the body’s innate ability to heal itself, or the Vis medicatrix naturae, is active.

    With a gentile supportive voice, Dr. Bennett combines her knowledge as a naturopathic doctor with her experience as a yoga teacher and long-term practitioner to create a truly unique experience in her classes.

  teacherBio: |
    When I was young, I loved dancing and making up my own stretches. At the time, I had no idea there was a name for what I was doing. One day I stumbled across a classic yoga book of my Uncles and flipped through the pages fascinated at postures like crow, cobra and down dog. I didn't know these poses would keep reappearing in my life, and I didn't ever really pursue yoga as I grew, it just kept finding me. I believe yoga is present naturally in all of us if we can quiet our minds to hear it. For me, the beauty of yoga is not just to move your physical body, but to encourage the moving and shifting on a mental and spiritual level too.

    When you come to my class, you will experience a strong foundation of alignment, but I hope you sweat and laugh and enjoy some freedom too. I will remind you to breathe, and breathe deeply. I enjoy exploring poses and flowing movement. I am truly a guide to help move you through a sequence and I hope the end result will be that we all find a little more clarity for our everyday lives, because that is when you know yoga is at work. Anita is a ceritified RYT-500, having comleted her 200hr training in 2013 with Y-Yoga, and her 300hr advanced training with Christine Price Clark at the Vancouver School of Yoga and Massage in 2014.

  teacherBio: |
    After traveling and living abroad for the past few years, Jenn is happy to bring her yoga teaching back to Vancouver. Jenn’s profound interest in body awareness, movement and mindfulness has led her to study under inspiring teachers in India, Bali, Europe and North America. Her explorations led her to deeper mind-body studies and earned Jenn a Bachelor Degree in Kinesiology, Diploma in Holistic Nutrition and 500 Hr Advanced Yoga Teacher Training certification. Passionate about the healing arts, Jenn brings a holistic understanding to her classes. Breath work, deep awareness, presence of mind, proper alignment and creative sequencing are the foundation of Jenn’s classes. Through mindful movement, Jenn encourages her students to tap into their oneness and experience the transformative practice of yoga. Jenn’s compassionate and attentive style make her perfect for new and advanced students looking to deepen their yogic path.
- teacherName: Niki Inglis

  teacherBio: |
    Diagnosed at age 29 with life-threatening asthma and debilitating arthritis, Niki took her first yoga class at a neighbourhood community center. Fully healed in a short time by the practice, she has devoted the last 22 years to sharing yoga with others. Along the way, she has raised three wise and beautiful girls, accumulated a wealth of knowledge about the human body and acquired a deep curiosity for the ways in which we learn, as individuals and together.

    Trained in Restorative, Hot and Aerial Yoga, she leads workshops and retreats worldwide. Her classes invite you to move more slowly, in order to feel more deeply. Gentle myofascial release techniques, yoga postures, the breath, music and deep rest are combined to create an environment where your body and mind can learn to find ease.

    Her deepest influence is Vijnana Yoga - a gentle but strong, inwardly-focused practice - and she strives to bring its sense of presence and peace to all of her classes. Niki encourages questions, community and connection above all else and gratitude towards her teachers, students included, guides her every move.
- teacherName: Claire Hurley

  teacherBio: |
    Claire’s love for yoga began to unfold in university whilst studying for her experimental physics degree. Continuing her asana practice during her many years as a high school teacher, it was her background in science that brought her to delve deeper into the spiritual aspects of yoga. The practice has helped Claire experience deep calmness and clarity, feel more connected and be more at peace. Relocating to Vancouver in 2016, Claire quickly immersed herself in the many yoga offerings of the city. It was a natural progression to combine her passion for yoga and learning with her teaching background, and so she completed her 200 hour yoga teacher training with Karma Teachers, soon followed by a 40 hour yin training.

    In her classes, Claire aims to help you connect with the power of your breath, the joy of moving in your body, the art of sharing in community and the many holistic benefits of your yoga practice that you can take off your mat. She recognises the honour that comes with being in the sacred seat of teacher, and wishes to give students a space to tune inwards and intuitively find what they need.
